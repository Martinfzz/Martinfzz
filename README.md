### Hi, it's @Martinfzz!

I'm an engineer learning Full Stack development at THP to build another future
In 2019 I made the start of what will be the beginning of a new life.
I took my bike and I've travelled during 5 months in the Nordic countries.

After that, everything was clear. I wanted to take another path and to start coding.
It took a litlle moment but now, I'm learning how to put my ideas on the Internet and it's very cool!

I also moved in Germany and I'm currently learning german.

What a journey!
